# OneMenu Angular Client

**OneMenu** is a collaborative meal planning app designed to help users create a shared menu  
by allowing invited guests to vote on various starters, main courses, desserts, and more.  
An optimization algorithm processes all the votes and selects the menu that  
**maximizes overall satisfaction** across the group â€” ideal for events, dinners, and parties.

## Features

- Create voting sessions for menus
- Invite guests to participate
- Choose from multiple dishes (starters, mains, desserts, etc.)
- Intelligent algorithm picks the best global combination
- User authentication & session management
- Mobile-first frontend experience

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.2.

## Environments

<https://angular.dev/tools/cli/environments>

```bash
# TODO after cloning !
ng generate environments
```

```Typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  AUTH0_DOMAIN: '...',
  AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: '...',
  AUTH0_API_AUDIENCE: '...',
  API_URL: '...',
};
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.  
The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default.  
You can choose one that suits your needs.  
Not implemented here.
